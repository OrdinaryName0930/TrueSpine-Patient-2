MCP Server Enforcement

Condition: If the code/project requires MCP server access.

Action:

Always route code generation and dependencies through the MCP server.

Validate the connection before generation.

Log all MCP server usage.

Automatic Assembly & Debugging

Trigger: Immediately after code generation.

Action:

Assemble/compile the generated code.

Perform a debug pass to detect syntax, logic, or runtime errors.

Generate a detailed error report.

Automatic Error Fixing

Condition: Errors are found during the assembly/debug step.

Action:

Attempt automated correction using:

Syntax fixes (missing semicolons, mismatched brackets, wrong variable types, etc.)

Dependency resolution (imports, libraries, references)

Minor logic adjustments where possible (e.g., uninitialized variables)

Re-run assembly/debug after each fix to confirm resolution.

If an error persists beyond auto-fix capability, halt the process and report detailed info to the user.
